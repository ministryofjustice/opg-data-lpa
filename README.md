# opg-data-lpa

## Purpose

OPG Data LPA is a repo to build a rest API for interactions with LPA. Currently it includes GET endpoints for
gathering information about LPAs from sirius.

In the future it may be expanded to have further GET endpoints or PUT, POST or DELETE endpoints for  strictly
LPA related functions.

## Tech stack

- API Gateway
- Lambda
- Dynamodb

## Languages used

- Terraform (for infrastructure)
- Python (for lambda code)
- OpenApi spec (for building the REST API against API Gateway)
